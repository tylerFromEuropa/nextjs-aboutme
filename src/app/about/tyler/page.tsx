                <p>My story begins in 1994, on a cold day in the winter. That's when I arrived from the moon! Just kidding...</p>

                <p>
                    I have always been interested in technology and from before I could walk I sat at a typewriter mashing buttons, from there it evolved to computers. I love tinkering with them, building them, maintaining them and everything in between.
                    From day zero (hehe, see what I did there?) I have been glued to a computer and never let go since.
                </p>

                <p>Now I am beginning my journey as a junior full stack developer and hoping to achieve great things in the software world. I recently finished Tech Educators' MERN full stack bootcamp.</p>

                <p>That's all, folks!</p>
